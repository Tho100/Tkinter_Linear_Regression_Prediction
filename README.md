**How does it works: On this program 'X' entry is the column name where we used in order to train it while on the 'Y' entry is the name of column prediction value we want as our output, where 'Input Value' is the value we set for 'X'. So in this case we inserted 9.4 as our input (Total Hours) and it shows that the predicted scores we will earned is 91%**
